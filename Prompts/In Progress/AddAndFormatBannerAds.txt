I have added two banner ads at the top and bottom of index.html. 
Currently they are too close to the main application making it feel squeezed. 
Please space them out a bit more to make more room for the ads to be on the periphreal and the main content to be easily accessible and not feel cramped in by the ad banners.

Also, I want to add two banner ads to the left and right of the container div with the main content of my application. 

Here is the code for the side banner ads:
<script type="text/javascript">
	atOptions = {
		'key' : '16437c311e6ec7df63fa476108684215',
		'format' : 'iframe',
		'height' : 300,
		'width' : 160,
		'params' : {}
	};
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/16437c311e6ec7df63fa476108684215/invoke.js"></script>

Please add these side banner ads to the sides of the app away from the container, keeping in mind not to make it feel cramped.

They still feel a little close to the center content. Please space them away from the content about double the distance they are at the moment. 
Also move the side ads down a bit to make them feel more centered.
