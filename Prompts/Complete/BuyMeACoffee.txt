I want to add a buy me a coffee link to this application. Using https://grimdawncharacterrandomizer.github.io/ as an example, 
find the buy me a coffee link and add a buy me a coffee link to index.html with a similar style and the same functionality as https://grimdawncharacterrandomizer.github.io/.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It should look like this and be below the app in the same style as the application as a whole. 
<div class="coffee-link">
            <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/EnigmaMachineDev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                â˜• Buy me a coffee
            </a>
        </div>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please move the buy me a coffee link under the main container and centered under the container.
