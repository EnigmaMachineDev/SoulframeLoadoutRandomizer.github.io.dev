Create me a json file called randomizer.json. This file should have 4 objects, Primary, Secondary, Pact, and Armor. 

The Primary Section should be a list of Primary Weapons, and links to those weapons on avakot (wiki.avakot.org/Items/Weapons/{weaponname here in lowercase with spaces removed}) I will list those below.
